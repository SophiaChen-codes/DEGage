Title: Detects Differentially Expressed Genes In scRNA-seq Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Alicia Petrany, Yong Chen
Maintainer: <petran54@students.rowan.edu>
Description: Can detect pairwise differential expression with DEGage(), or differential expression across groups with DEGage_multitest(). Count Prefiltering and celltype annotations can be generated with DEGage_preprocess, and a the full processing and multi-test workflow is available with DEGage_complete(). Finally, DEGage_simulate() can be used to generate very simple simulation data with different proportions of dropouts.
