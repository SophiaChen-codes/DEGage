\usage{
DEGage_Simulation(
  ngenes,
  ndegs,
  cellgroups,
  lfc = 1,
  prop.zeros = 0.3,
  seed = NULL,
  ncores = 4
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ngenes}{is the number of genes to be simulated total}

\item{ndegs}{is the number of genes to be differentially expressed}

\item{cellgroups}{is factor with integers corresponding to cell conditions}

\item{lfc}{is either an integer or vector with a length of ndegs which dictates log fold change value to adjust means for differentially expressed genes}

\item{seed}{sets a seed for random generation. If user does not input one, a random seed is generated}

\item{ncores}{the number of cores to allocated for parallel computing}
}
\description{
Simulates counts. DEG's are simulated under two conditions
